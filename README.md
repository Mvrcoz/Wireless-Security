# Wireless Network Security
**Objective**: Used Wireshark and Aircrack-ng to capture and analyze wireless traffic, assessing network vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer for packet inspection.
- **Aircrack-ng**: Wireless security suite for assessing WEP/WPA encryption.

## Key Concepts
- **WEP vs. WPA**: Understanding of wireless encryption standards and vulnerabilities.
- **Packet Analysis**: Monitoring and analyzing network packets for potential security threats.

## Lab Overview
1. **Packet Capture**: Collected and analyzed Wi-Fi packets, identifying usernames, passwords, and encrypted files.
2. **Encryption Cracking**: Used Aircrack-ng to test vulnerabilities in wireless encryption protocols.

## Learnings
- Developed skills in wireless security assessment.
- Insight into packet capture techniques and wireless encryption weaknesses.
